1. The business task of identifying key drivers for used car prices can be reframed as a data problem of predicting car prices based on various features or attributes. This entails utilizing machine learning techniques to build a prediction model by examining past used car sales data. The goal is to determine and measure how various elements, including vehicle age, mileage, brand, condition, and other pertinent characteristics, affect used car prices. Preprocessing data, feature engineering, choosing a model, and evaluating it are all part of the effort in order to find significant trends and insights that may help with price optimization and used vehicle market decision-making.
2. In the first step we would take a look at the data and Understand dataset size and structure. After we look at the data we take a look at the summary statistics and analyze numerical and categorical summaries. Once we do that we try to look for the missing values and address them. Once we take care of the missing data we look for the data distributions and try to understand visualize variable distributions. After we visualize the variable distributuibs we want to compare the relationships. 
3. Handle Integrity Issues: Look for and fix any issues with data integrity, such as inconsistent or redundant data types. Data Cleaning: Address outliers, missing numbers, and any other discrepancies to clean up the data. Feature engineering is the process of developing new features using domain expertise or discoveries made during research. This might involve combining existing features, creating interaction terms, or extracting information from text or datetime fields. Feature Transformation: Perform transformations on features as necessary, such as scaling numerical features, applying logarithmic transformations to handle skewness, or normalizing data to a standard scale. Prepare for Modeling: Encode categorical variables, split the data into training and testing sets, and perform any final preprocessing steps necessary for modeling with the 'sklearn' library.
